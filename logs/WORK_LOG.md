# Work Log

## 2026-04-06 — Session 41

- Completed the light-mode contrast follow-up in `assets/style.css`
- Darkened the shared secondary text hierarchy to blue-slate values (`--muted`, `--dim`, `--steel`) so light mode no longer falls back to washed gray copy
- Fixed unreadable project/game titles on dark hero art with bright text + stronger overlay treatment in light mode
- Converted shared dark content/card patterns (`.feature-block`, `.info-block`, `.stream-item`, patch panels, game/project cards) into true light-mode surfaces
- IGNIS rescored: 46,115/100,000 · FORGE · 74.1% through tier
- Pushed: pending commit SHA
- SIL: 409/500 · Velocity: 1 · Debt: →

## 2026-04-06 — Session 40

- Refined the public-site light mode in `assets/style.css` with a warmer premium palette, stronger contrast tokens, and shared light-mode overrides for cards, chips, buttons, forms, badges, nav, footer, and section chrome
- Fixed a systemic readability gap by overriding `--steel` in light mode; many components were inheriting a pale gray accent that washed out on the white background
- Synced browser theme color in `assets/theme-toggle.js` to the new light background
- Verification: `npm.cmd test -- tests/theme-persistence.spec.js` ran; Chromium failures are tied to an existing `body[data-theme]` expectation mismatch, Firefox/WebKit browsers missing locally

## 2026-04-06 — Session 39

- Actioned all 3 SIL Now items in one pass
- Mobile nav entrance animation: @keyframes nav-enter (translateY -6px → 0, opacity 0 → 1, 0.18s ease) applied to .nav-center.open in ≤980px media block
- CSS guard: `.hero-art > .status { position: absolute; top: 1rem; left: 1rem; z-index: 2 }` — regression prevention for S36 badge-overlap bug
- Lighthouse CI: wait-on step added (120s timeout, 5s interval) polling live site before Lighthouse runs
- SW: CACHE_NAME bumped to `vaultspark-20260406-silpol` (style.css changed)
- IGNIS scored: 46,855/100,000 · FORGE · 79.0% (delta: -236 from time decay)
- Pushed: `0cb8e52`
- SIL: 400/500 · Velocity: 0 (all SIL) · Debt: →

## 2026-04-06 — Session 38

- Fixed persistent iOS mobile nav blur: root cause was .site-header::before backdrop-filter (not the overlay itself) — disabled at ≤980px in media query; GPU compositing layer from header was containing the position:fixed nav overlay on iOS Safari
- Pushed: `bdbd378`
- IGNIS rescored: 47,091/100,000 · FORGE · 80.6% through tier

## 2026-04-06 — Session 37

- Set STRIPE_GIFT_PRICE_ID: product `prod_UHhMAimiSwXo0S` + price `price_1TJ7xbGMN60PfJYsPCs5wUUz` ($24.99 one-time) via Stripe API; secret set via Supabase CLI
- Google Search Console: GSC property verified, sitemap submitted
- IGNIS scored first time: 38,899/100,000 · Tier: FORGE; fields added to PROJECT_STATUS.json
- Staging confirmed: website.staging.vaultsparkstudios.com HTTP 200 ✓
- SIL: 399/500 · Velocity: 4 · Debt: → (SIL/closeout deferred; recovered S38)

## 2026-04-06 — Session 36

- Fixed mobile nav blur: removed backdrop-filter from .nav-center.open (background 0.98 opacity — blur was invisible but created GPU compositing artifact making menu text blurry on mobile)
- Fixed FORGE/SPARKED/VAULTED status badge overlap on 8 project pages: badge was inside .hero-art-content (position:relative) so `position:absolute;top:1rem;left:1rem` positioned relative to the content div at the bottom, landing the badge directly on the h1; moved badge to direct child of .hero-art matching game page pattern
- Pushed: `9535d01`

## 2026-04-06 — Session 35

- Diagnosed Lighthouse SEO + axe-cli failures from session 34 push
- Root causes: Cloudflare AI Labyrinth rewrites robots.txt at CDN edge; vault-member intentionally noindex; "Learn More" non-descriptive link; ChromeDriver/Chrome version mismatch
- Fixed: .lighthouserc.json (robots-txt off), lighthouse.yml (vault-member removed), index.html (aria-label), accessibility.yml (browser-driver-manager)
- Pushed: `929a884`

## 2026-04-06 — Session 34

This public repo no longer carries the detailed internal work log.

Public-safe note:
- internal session-by-session execution detail now lives in the private Studio OS / ops repository
- a local private backup of the pre-sanitization work log was preserved outside this repo on 2026-04-03
- 2026-04-03 closeout: public-repo sanitization follow-through completed and local Playwright credential handling was moved behind a private ignored file
