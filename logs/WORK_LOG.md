# Work Log

## 2026-04-16 — Session 77 (shell hardening + homepage regression gate)

- scripts/build-shell-assets.mjs: created the generated shared-shell release pipeline; fingerprints `style.css`, `theme-toggle.js`, `nav-toggle.js`, and `shell-health.js`; rewrites HTML entrypoints; emits `assets/shell-manifest.json`; and cleans old generated shell files
- assets/shell-health.js + index.html: added homepage shell-health monitoring, force-reveal fallback for stuck forge letters, and public-safe analytics signaling for degraded header/hero shell state
- sw.js: rewired shell caching so only fingerprinted shared shell assets are cacheable and mutable source shell URLs are bypassed
- package.json + scripts/run-local-browser-verify.mjs + scripts/run-live-browser-verify.mjs + scripts/release-confidence.mjs + .github/workflows/e2e.yml: wired the new shell build/verify flow into build, local verify, live verify, release-confidence, and CI
- tests/homepage-hero-regression.spec.js + tests/navigation.spec.js: added dedicated homepage shell coverage and aligned the nav expectation with the current 9-link games menu
- Verification:
  - `npm run build` → passed
  - `npm run build:check` → passed
  - `node scripts/verify-sw-assets.mjs` → passed
  - `node scripts/run-local-browser-verify.mjs tests/homepage-hero-regression.spec.js tests/computed-styles.spec.js tests/navigation.spec.js` → passed (8 checks)
- Follow-through:
  - `scripts/run-live-browser-verify.mjs`: fixed Windows execution by running `.cmd` Playwright launches through the shell when needed
  - `tests/homepage-hero-regression.spec.js`: increased timeout for real live-site runs so post-push verification stops flaking on the fixed 3s settle window
  - `node scripts/run-live-browser-verify.mjs` → passed against both production and staging after push
- Closeout: Studio OS write-back completed; generated truth refreshed; repo committed and pushed to `main`; homepage shell/browser verification passed on both production and staging

## 2026-04-16 — Session 76 (feedback loop + release confidence)

- assets/micro-feedback.js: created shared browser-local micro-feedback module for goal/blocker/usefulness capture and local summary rendering
- index.html + membership/index.html + vaultsparked/index.html + join/index.html + invite/index.html + studio-pulse/index.html + assets/style.css + sw.js: wired/styled the new shared feedback surface across the main public conversion pages and bumped the service-worker cache
- assets/public-intelligence.js + assets/telemetry-matrix.js + assets/trust-depth.js: upgraded shared intelligence/trust surfaces so feedback summaries can enrich runtime reads
- scripts/generate-public-intelligence.mjs + scripts/lib/public-intelligence-contracts.mjs + api/public-intelligence.json + context/contracts/*.json: extended the public-safe payload/contracts so feedback rollups can bridge into website/Hub/social-dashboard surfaces
- assets/adaptive-cta.js + assets/pathways-router.js + assets/network-spine.js: added stronger hesitation-aware/adaptive narrative behavior
- scripts/release-confidence.mjs: created scoped release-confidence gate
- scripts/run-local-browser-verify.mjs + tests/micro-feedback.spec.js + package.json: added focused `intelligence` verify tier support, dedicated micro-feedback coverage, and `npm run verify:confidence`
- assets/intent-state.js: fixed the real local-preview blocker by preventing `noteExposure()` from emitting shared change events and causing rerender/exposure loops on heavy pages
- Verification:
  - `node --check assets/micro-feedback.js assets/intent-state.js assets/adaptive-cta.js assets/pathways-router.js assets/network-spine.js assets/public-intelligence.js assets/telemetry-matrix.js assets/trust-depth.js scripts/release-confidence.mjs scripts/run-local-browser-verify.mjs` → passed

- context/TASK_BOARD.md: added the Session 75 Genius queue and the next SIL follow-through items (`Release confidence gate`, `Micro-feedback engine`)
- assets/intent-state.js: created the shared visitor-state runtime for intent, confidence, stage, trust, world affinity, membership temperature, and returning status
- assets/adaptive-cta.js + assets/pathways-router.js + assets/related-content.js + assets/funnel-tracking.js: rewired the existing intelligent surfaces to consume the shared state instead of maintaining separate intent logic
- assets/telemetry-matrix.js: created a shared conversion-read surface for homepage, membership, and VaultSparked
- assets/trust-depth.js: created a shared trust/proof/hesitation/founder-promise module for the main conversion surfaces
- assets/network-spine.js: created a shared ecosystem/network-cohesion surface for homepage, membership, VaultSparked, and Studio Pulse
- assets/style.css + index.html + membership/index.html + vaultsparked/index.html + join/index.html + invite/index.html + studio-pulse/index.html + sw.js: wired the new runtime/modules into the public site and bumped the cache forward
- Verification:
  - `node --check assets/intent-state.js` → passed
  - `node --check assets/telemetry-matrix.js` → passed
  - `node --check assets/trust-depth.js` → passed

## 2026-04-15 — Session 74 (visitor-intelligence + tooling pass)

- assets/pathways-router.js: created — constrained visitor pathways (`player`, `member`, `supporter`, `investor`, `lore`) with remembered local intent and shared rendering on homepage, membership, VaultSparked, join, and invite
- assets/related-content.js: created — shared “continue through the vault” rails to improve graph cohesion across public surfaces
- assets/adaptive-cta.js: upgraded to personalize CTA copy/notes from remembered pathway intent instead of using only login/referral/membership-intent state
- assets/style.css + index.html + membership/index.html + vaultsparked/index.html + join/index.html + invite/index.html: wired and styled the new pathway/related rails across the main public entry surfaces
- vaultsparked/billing-toggle.js + vaultsparked/vaultsparked-checkout.js + vaultsparked/index.html: added annual-checkout honesty gate; annual pricing preview remains visible, but checkout now blocks cleanly until real annual Stripe plan keys exist
- scripts/startup-snapshot.mjs + prompts/start.md + package.json: added a deterministic startup snapshot helper and npm shortcut
- scripts/verify-live-headers.mjs + cloudflare/deploy-worker-local.ps1 + package.json: codified the live header verification path and the manual local Worker deploy fallback
- scripts/run-local-browser-verify.mjs + tests/intelligence-surfaces.spec.js: added `core` / `extended` local verify tiers and new coverage for pathway/related rails
- sw.js: cache name bumped and new shared JS assets added to STATIC_ASSETS
- Verification:
  - `node scripts/startup-snapshot.mjs --json` → passed
  - `node scripts/generate-public-intelligence.mjs` → passed
  - static `rg` wiring checks for pathways/related rails across homepage, membership, VaultSparked, join, and invite → passed
  - `node scripts/run-local-browser-verify.mjs --tier core` → blocked in this environment (`spawn EPERM` in sandbox; escalated retries timed out before Playwright completed)
  - `node ..\\vaultspark-studio-ops\\scripts\\ops.mjs doctor --update-json`, `state-vector --project .`, `entropy --update --project .`, `genome-snapshot --project .`, `genome-history --project .`, and `content-pipeline` → passed
  - `node ..\\vaultspark-studio-ops\\scripts\\ops.mjs rescore --project vaultsparkstudios-website` plus direct IGNIS CLI fallback → failed (`regretAverage` TypeError inside founder-brief generation); prior 2026-04-15 IGNIS score remains the current fresh value
- Closeout: full Studio OS write-back completed; repo committed and pushed to `main`; no production runtime deploy performed

## 2026-04-15 — Session 73 (startup signal cleanup)

- prompts/start.md: resynced from studio-ops template line `3.2`; preserved S71 targeted-read discipline while adding the newer auto-mode, secrets discovery, blocker-preflight, and execution-first startup rules
- prompts/closeout.md: resynced to template line `3.2`; retained the S72 public-intelligence gate and added blocker-preflight language for Human Action Required handling
- docs/CREATIVE_DIRECTION_RECORD.md: added S73 entry capturing the directive that startup/status warnings must be treated as real debt and cleared, not tolerated
- context/PROJECT_STATUS.json: updated IGNIS to `46,489 FORGE` (`ignisScoreDelta: -819`, `ignisLastComputed: 2026-04-15`); removed the stale-IGNIS blocker; refreshed current focus/milestone copy
- context/CURRENT_STATE.md, TASK_BOARD.md, LATEST_HANDOFF.md, TRUTH_AUDIT.md, DECISIONS.md: updated so repo truth no longer reports IGNIS as stale and now records the prompt-template sync
- closeout ops: ran `doctor --update-json`, `state-vector --project .`, `entropy --update --project .`, `genome-snapshot --project .`, `genome-history --project .`, `rescore`, and `content-pipeline`; refreshed sibling `portfolio/REVENUE_SIGNALS.md`
- Verification:
  - `..\\vaultspark-ignis\\node_modules\\.bin\\tsx.cmd ..\\vaultspark-ignis\\cli.ts score .` → passed (run escalated because sandbox blocks `tsx`/`esbuild` child-process spawn)
- Deploy: none; protocol/status truth cleanup only

## 2026-04-15 — Session 72 (shared bridge + build gate + local verify)

- scripts/generate-public-intelligence.mjs: rewritten to emit `api/public-intelligence.json` plus `context/contracts/website-public.json`, `hub.json`, and `social-dashboard.json`; added `--check` drift mode; generator now reads the latest handoff block instead of full append-only history
- scripts/lib/public-intelligence-contracts.mjs: created — shared contract builder using runtime-pack metadata and Studio Hub registry/social metadata
- package.json: added `build`, `build:check`, and `verify:local`
- prompts/closeout.md: added public-intelligence gate so generated intelligence/contracts must be refreshed after truth changes
- .github/workflows/e2e.yml: added `npm run build:check` drift gate
- scripts/local-preview-server.mjs + scripts/run-local-browser-verify.mjs: created local static preview + Playwright wrapper for local-first unshipped verification; dynamic local port + Windows-safe command invocation
- index.html + studio-pulse/index.html + assets/home-intelligence.js + assets/studio-pulse-live.js: now surface ecosystem/social bridge metadata to the public site
- tests/compliance-pages.spec.js: cookie-banner tests now clear localStorage after first navigation/reload instead of touching `about:blank`
- Verification:
  - `npm run build:check` → passed
  - `node scripts/run-local-browser-verify.mjs tests/computed-styles.spec.js` → passed
  - `node scripts/run-local-browser-verify.mjs tests/computed-styles.spec.js tests/vaultsparked-csp.spec.js` → passed
- Deploy: none; repo/runtime update only
- SIL: 447/500 · Velocity: 3 · Debt: ↓

## 2026-04-15 — Session 71 (startup prompt hardening)

- Root-caused clipped startup briefs to oversized context reads during `start`, especially full reads of `context/LATEST_HANDOFF.md` and historical `context/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md`
- prompts/start.md: added targeted-read discipline for append-only files; startup now reads only the newest handoff block, the SIL rolling header plus latest entry when needed, and probe-first optional-file checks
- context/: CURRENT_STATE, DECISIONS, TASK_BOARD, LATEST_HANDOFF, TRUTH_AUDIT, PROJECT_STATUS, SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP updated to preserve the new startup rule
- Verification: reviewed `git diff -- prompts/start.md` and matched the new rule against current `LATEST_HANDOFF.md` / `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md` structure
- Deploy: none; protocol/docs change only
- SIL: 428/500 · Velocity: 1 · Debt: ↓

## 2026-04-15 — Session 68 (structural upgrade batch)

- scripts/csp-audit.mjs: created — repo-wide inline-script hash audit; compares inline script hashes against page CSP, canonical CSP, and Worker CSP
- tests/computed-styles.spec.js: created — Chromium render-integrity smoke for homepage (computed body background, hero padding, header border, zero page errors)
- .github/workflows/e2e.yml: added `node scripts/csp-audit.mjs` gate and computed-style smoke step
- prompts/closeout.md: Step 0 hardened with git-clean gate + CSP audit requirement for inline/CSP changes
- assets/funnel-tracking.js: created — shared CTA/view tracking via declarative `data-track-*` attributes
- assets/recent-ships.js: created — pulls recent shipped work from `/changelog/` and hydrates `[data-recent-ships]`
- assets/contact-page.js, assets/join-page.js, assets/invite-page.js: created — externalized public-page runtime and added stronger success/error/next-step feedback states
- assets/vaultsparked-proof.js: created — live member/progression proof for `/vaultsparked/`
- assets/style.css: added shared `live-proof-*`, `recent-ship-*`, `feedback-panel`, and `journal-link-inline` styles
- contact/index.html, join/index.html, invite/index.html: removed large inline runtime; wired new external assets and feedback panels
- membership/index.html, vaultsparked/index.html, index.html: added CTA tracking, recent shipped work sections, stronger next-step messaging, and live proof surfaces
- Verification:
  - `node scripts/csp-audit.mjs` → fails on broad legacy repo debt (expected truth surfaced by new gate)
  - `npx playwright test tests/computed-styles.spec.js --reporter=list --project=chromium` → passed
  - `npm.cmd run validate:browser-render` → missing local script in package.json
- SIL: 436/500 · Velocity: 7 · Debt: ↓

## 2026-04-14 — Session 67 (CSP hotfix — intent redirected)

- index.html: removed `media="print" onload="this.media='all'"` async-CSS trick (inline event handler was CSP-blocked → stylesheet stayed print-only → site rendered unstyled in prod); `<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style.css" />` now loads normally (critical CSS already inlined, no FOUC concern)
- index.html + vaultsparked/index.html + cloudflare/security-headers-worker.js + scripts/propagate-csp.mjs: 5 new SHA-256 hashes added to `script-src` (signal-panel VAULT_LIVE_URL script 1UY3+…, Kit form-wiring tzcyzR…, dZNuqX…, 6LhxaK…, GEw0Ad…) — hashes computed from local inline script bodies; match browser-reported blocks
- scripts/propagate-csp.mjs: ran → 88 pages updated; --check-skipped → OK on all 3 registry entries
- scripts/csp-hash-registry.json: vaultsparked entry updated with 5 new hashes in cspContent; lastVerified → 2026-04-14
- Commit: 5fd3918 (94 files, +96/−97) · rebased onto origin/main (pulled `b890e69 leaderboard data` + `2279708 sw bump`) · pushed → b4e1088
- SIL: — · Velocity: 1 · Debt: →

## 2026-04-13 — Session 65

- tests/vault-wall.spec.js: REWRITTEN — `#rank-dist-bar` visible assertion, `#vw-podium` visible assertion, `page.on('pageerror')` CSP listener, rank-dist-seg `.count()` soft warn (allows 0 in CI), auth-free public route check; retires `[SIL:2⛔]` manual smoke protocol
- scripts/csp-hash-registry.json: CREATED — JSON snapshot of CSP meta content for 3 SKIP pages: vaultsparked/index.html (custom hashes), 404.html (unsafe-inline, documented debt), offline.html (unsafe-inline, documented debt); `version: "1.0"`, `updatedAt: "2026-04-13"`
- scripts/propagate-csp.mjs: `--check-skipped` flag added at top of file; `checkSkipped()` function reads registry, extracts current CSP via regex, diffs strings, exits 1 on drift; conditional dispatch at `walk(ROOT)` site
- membership/index.html: `data-reveal="fade-up"` added to 5 sections (mem-tiers, mem-identity, mem-discount, mem-community, mem-final-cta); `<script src="/assets/scroll-reveal.js" defer>` added before `</body>` (was missing)
- press/index.html: `data-reveal="fade-up"` added to 6 sections (key facts, quote, logos, games catalog, vault member, contact); `<script src="/assets/scroll-reveal.js" defer>` added before `</body>` (was missing)
- context/: CURRENT_STATE (S65 snapshot), TASK_BOARD (S66 runway pre-load), LATEST_HANDOFF (S65 full detail + S66 intent), PROJECT_STATUS (silScore 448, velocity 6, debt ↓, currentSession 66), SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP (S65 entry + rolling status), TRUTH_AUDIT (gold contrast + CSP registry note), WORK_LOG updated
- audits/2026-04-13-6.json: CREATED — S65 audit record

## 2026-04-07 — Session 45

- Root-caused auth tab switching bug on `vault-member/?ref=username`: `showAuth()` and `showDashboard()` in `portal-auth.js` threw TypeError because `nav-account-wrap`, `nav-signin-link`, `nav-join-btn` were missing from `vault-member/index.html` nav-right — added all missing portal nav elements (notif bell wrap, nav account dropdown with trigger/avatar/name/menu, IDs on Sign In/Join links)
- Added null guards to `showAuth()` and `showDashboard()` in `portal-auth.js` for forward safety
- Added `?ref=username` referral handling in `portal-settings.js` init(): validates param, shows gold referral banner ("Invited by @username"), stores referrer in sessionStorage for future attribution
- Enhanced theme picker: hover preview (applies theme without saving, restores on mouse leave via `dropdown.mouseleave`), DEFAULT badge on active theme option, "✓ Default saved" button confirmation flash (1.8s), "Choose Theme" section header, active option gold tint background

- Root-caused mobile nav blur to `backdrop-filter: blur(2px)` on `#nav-backdrop` (iOS Safari GPU compositing layer bleeds blur to z-index:200 overlay above it) — removed it
- Fixed theme FOUC: `theme-toggle.js` now applies theme class to `<html>` immediately (available in `<head>`); `propagate-nav.mjs` injected inline theme script at `<body>` start across all 72 pages — eliminates dark flash when navigating in light mode
- Redesigned mobile nav overlay: cubic-bezier animation, gold left-border active indicator, caret-as-button, improved CTA press states and spacing
- Replaced bare `<select>` theme picker with a custom button+dropdown component (color swatches per theme, active checkmark, scale+fade animation, keyboard/click-outside dismiss)

- Fixed a systemic readability gap by overriding `--steel` in light mode; many components were inheriting a pale gray accent that washed out on the white background
- Synced browser theme color in `assets/theme-toggle.js` to the new light background

## 2026-04-13 — Session 58

- Fixed `/members/` profile loading regression caused by the hardened CSP blocking the inline directory script.
- Added `assets/members-directory.js`, moved the directory query/render/search/filter logic into that external script, and replaced the inline clear-filter handler with event delegation.
- Made the member query tolerate current `vault_points`/`rank_title` fields with legacy `points` fallback.
- Bumped `sw.js` cache name and added `/assets/members-directory.js` to `STATIC_ASSETS`.

## 2026-04-15 — Session 70

- Converted the website audit into shipped architecture instead of leaving it as a recommendation list
- Added `scripts/generate-public-intelligence.mjs` and `api/public-intelligence.json` as a public-safe bridge from Studio OS truth to the live site
- Rewired `/studio-pulse/` to consume generated truth via `assets/public-intelligence.js` and `assets/studio-pulse-live.js`
- Added a homepage “Studio Intelligence” surface plus shared runtime in `assets/home-intelligence.js`
- Unified proof counters across homepage, membership, and VaultSparked with `assets/live-proof.js`
- Added adaptive CTA behavior across homepage, membership, VaultSparked, join, and invite with `assets/adaptive-cta.js`
- Extended funnel telemetry to stage-oriented flow events in `assets/funnel-tracking.js` and join/contact/invite scripts
- Verification: generation + hook scan passed; live-site Playwright smoke still points at undeployed production and is not a valid local verification of the new code

## 2026-04-15 — Session 70 follow-through

- Extracted canonical page/Worker/redirect CSP variants into `config/csp-policy.mjs`
- Rewired `scripts/propagate-csp.mjs`, `scripts/csp-audit.mjs`, and `cloudflare/security-headers-worker.js` to consume the shared CSP source
- Re-propagated the canonical page CSP across the repo and revalidated skipped pages via `node scripts/propagate-csp.mjs --check-skipped`
- Hardened legacy `investor/**` redirects by removing inline GA/bootstrap/redirect scripts and replacing them with minimal redirect documents plus `assets/redirect-page.js`
- Regenerated `api/public-intelligence.json` after memory updates so the public payload reflects the current Session 70 truth
- Verification: `node scripts/generate-public-intelligence.mjs` passed; `node scripts/propagate-csp.mjs --check-skipped` passed; `node scripts/csp-audit.mjs` passed

## 2026-04-15 — Session 70 closeout

- Refreshed `context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `LATEST_HANDOFF.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `TRUTH_AUDIT.md`, `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md`, and `PROJECT_STATUS.json` to reflect the final pushed state
- Re-generated `api/public-intelligence.json` after the final memory updates so the public payload matches closeout truth
- Generated per-project state outputs: `context/STATE_VECTOR.json`, `context/GENOME_HISTORY.json`, and `docs/GENOME_HISTORY.md`
- Updated protocol entropy successfully; IGNIS stale report succeeded, but project re-score failed and remains an open tooling blocker
- Prepared audit closeout artifact for 2026-04-15 and finalized the repo for commit/push
