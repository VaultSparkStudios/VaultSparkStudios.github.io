# Decisions

Public-safe decisions retained in this repo:

### 2026-04-12 — Genesis Vault Member: badge naming and slot ownership (S56)

- Status: active
- Decision: The first-100 achievement badge is named "Genesis Vault Member" (slug: `genesis_vault_member`). "Founding Vault Member" was rejected to avoid legal ambiguity with the term "founder" (corporate/ownership connotations). "Pioneer" was scored and rejected as generic and potentially dated. "Genesis" won on distinctiveness, brand fit, longevity, and community flex factor.
- Slot ownership: Studio owner accounts (DreadSpike, OneKingdom, VaultSpark, Voidfall) hold the badge permanently but do not consume any of the 100 public slots. The `maybe_award_genesis_badge()` function excludes those UUIDs from the rank count, ensuring all 100 slots are reserved for public members.
- Why it matters: Protects the studio legally; makes the badge more memorable and community-meaningful; ensures public members feel the full weight of the limited slot count.

### 2026-04-06 — Light mode remains token-driven in the shared design system

- Status: active
- Decision: light-mode fixes should be applied in `assets/style.css` and theme metadata rather than page-by-page HTML patches whenever the issue is shared across public pages
- Why: the unreadable text problem was systemic (`--steel` and translucent dark-mode carryovers), so a token-and-surface pass is lower risk, easier to maintain, and keeps light mode a first-class global experience
- Preservation: page-specific CSS can still layer on top, but shared readability issues should be solved at the design-system level first

### 2026-03-31 — Public website repo keeps only public-safe operational material

- Status: active
- Decision: detailed handoffs, work logs, audits, local settings, and operator-only notes should not live in the public website repository in full detail

### 2026-04-03 — Public repo sanitization expanded to Studio OS tracked files

- Status: active
- Decision: tracked Studio OS context, log, audit, handoff, and local-tooling files in this repo were reduced to public-safe summaries or pointers
- Why: the website can stay deployable without exposing internal execution history, operator workflows, or sensitive planning detail
- Preservation: a local private backup of the pre-sanitization material was created outside the repo before the tracked copies were sanitized

### 2026-04-06 — IGNIS scoring wired to closeout protocol

- Status: active
- Decision: run `npx tsx cli.ts score` from `vaultspark-studio-ops/ignis/src/` at every closeout; update `ignisScore`/`ignisGrade`/`ignisLastComputed` in `context/PROJECT_STATUS.json`
- Why: Meta-Reasoning Self-Score Awareness was 20.7/100 due to only 3 sessions of history; compounding score history each closeout is the primary lever to push COGNITION and FORESIGHT pillars from D → C

### 2026-04-03 — Local Playwright credentials moved behind a private ignored file

- Status: active
- Decision: `.env.playwright.local.private` is now the preferred local credential source for Playwright, while `.env.playwright.local` stays safe as a template-style local file
- Why: local tests still need credentials, but the repo-facing local file should not hold real values

## 2026-04-06 — CANON-008: All VaultSpark IP is proprietary by default

**Decision:** All code, content, assets, and designs created by VaultSpark Studios are proprietary and all rights are reserved by VaultSpark Studios LLC unless an open-source license is explicitly declared and approved by the Studio Owner. No agent may apply or imply an open-source license without Studio Owner direction.

**Applies to this project:** Yes — `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md` reflects this project's specific license status.

**Rationale:** VaultSpark Studios LLC is a commercial entity building owned IP. Open-sourcing any project without deliberate strategy gives away commercial advantage and creates ownership ambiguity.

**Studio canon:** `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` → CANON-008
