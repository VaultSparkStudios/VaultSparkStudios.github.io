## Now

- [x] **[SIL] robots.txt Cloudflare note** — added comment explaining Cloudflare AI Labyrinth injects directives at CDN edge (S46)
- [x] **[SIL] prefers-reduced-motion guard** — global `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rule already present in style.css (line ~1464); disables all animations including nav-enter. Done.

- [x] **[SIL] Theme persistence test contract** — replaced `#theme-select` assertions with `#theme-picker-btn` + `.theme-option[data-theme=x].active`; `body[data-theme]` assertions preserved (S46)
- [x] **[SIL] Nav backdrop opacity by theme** — added `--nav-backdrop-overlay` var to `:root` (dark) and `body.light-mode` (45% dark-navy); `#nav-backdrop` now uses var (S46)

## Later

- [x] **Voidfall teaser → full page** — expanded with Transmission Archive (3 fragments), The Signal world-building, Known Entities (3 entities), Saga meta grid; CSS added (S47)
- [x] **Sentry release tagging** — `.github/workflows/sentry-release.yml` created; tags each main push as a Sentry release; requires SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN, SENTRY_ORG, SENTRY_PROJECT repo secrets/vars (human action to configure, S47)

- [ ] **Web push test** — subscribe in portal, upload classified file, verify notification received

---

## Human Action Required

- [x] **[DB] `register_open` migration** — phase56 applied live (S48): `referred_by` column, `p_ref_by` param, milestones updated ✅
- [x] **[Sentry] Configure release workflow** — `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` secret set; org/project hardcoded in workflow; CI passing (S48) ✅
- [ ] **[WEB3FORMS]** Test contact form from browser — confirm email arrives at founder@vaultsparkstudios.com (server-side test blocked by Web3Forms free tier)
- [ ] **[WAF]** Confirm Cloudflare WAF JS Challenge rule for CN/RU/HK is active in dashboard (or provide API token)
- [ ] **[BEACON]** Run `node scripts/configure-beacon.mjs` in studio-ops → copy `.claude/beacon.env` here
- [ ] **[WEB3FORMS-KEYS]** Create 3 separate keys in Web3Forms dashboard (join/, contact/, data-deletion/) for per-form lead tracking [low priority]
- [x] **[DB] Founding Vault Badge** — migration applied 2026-04-12 via Supabase CLI; 4 founding members badged: DreadSpike, OneKingdom, VaultSpark, Voidfall ✅
- [x] **[CF-SECRETS]** Add `CF_API_TOKEN` (Zone/Cache Purge) and `CF_ZONE_ID` secrets to GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets; enables auto cache purge workflow added S53 ✅ (S54)
- [x] **[CSP-VERIFY]** After S53 deploy: open vault-member/index.html in DevTools console (incognito); confirm zero `Content-Security-Policy` errors ✅ (S54 — verified; remaining Cloudflare edge-injected inline scripts are platform-generated, unfixable with static hashes, accepted as limitation)
- [ ] **[CF-WORKER-TOKEN]** Add `CF_WORKER_API_TOKEN` secret to GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions. Needs Cloudflare API token with **Workers Scripts: Edit** + **Zone: Read** permissions (different from `CF_API_TOKEN` which is cache-purge only). Once set, every `cloudflare/**` push auto-deploys the Worker.
- [ ] **[DB] Phase59 public_profile migration** — run db-migrate workflow or `supabase db push` to apply `supabase-phase59-public-profile.sql`; adds `public_profile boolean DEFAULT true` to `vault_members`. Safe additive change; existing members stay opted-in. Required before portal toggle + vault-wall filter go live.
