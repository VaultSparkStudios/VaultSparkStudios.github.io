# Latest Handoff — VaultSparkStudios.github.io

Last updated: 2026-04-07 (Session 45)

## Session Intent: Session 45
Fix auth tab switching on `vault-member/?ref=username` referral link (users couldn't switch between Create Account / Sign In tabs); polish theme picker UX with explicit default-setting behavior.
**Outcome: Achieved** — auth bug root-caused (TypeError from missing portal nav HTML in index.html); all missing nav elements added; null guards added to showAuth/showDashboard; `?ref=` referral banner wired; theme picker upgraded with hover-preview, DEFAULT badge, confirmation flash.

## Where We Left Off (Session 45 — 2026-04-07)

- Shipped: 2 improvements — portal auth tab fix + theme picker polish
- Tests: N/A — no automated test run this session
- Deploy: pushed to `main` (`6fab57a`) · GitHub Pages auto

---

## Session Intent: Session 44
Fix mobile nav blur + clicks not working, redesign mobile nav for optimal UX, fix light mode theme issues from screenshots, ensure selected theme persists across all pages, make theme selector premium/polished.
**Outcome: Achieved** — all 5 goals shipped in one session; mobile blur root-caused to backdrop-filter on #nav-backdrop; theme FOUC eliminated via inline script on 72 pages; nav redesigned; premium custom theme picker built; light mode CSS gaps patched.

## Where We Left Off (Session 44 — 2026-04-07)

- Shipped: 5 improvements — mobile-nav (bug+UX), theme-persistence (FOUC fix), premium-picker, light-mode-css
- Tests: N/A — no automated test run this session
- Deploy: pushed to `main` (`4bd073e`) · GitHub Pages auto

---

## Session Intent: Session 43
Remove the false public claim that VaultSpark projects are open-source/MIT and replace it with the correct proprietary rights posture.
**Outcome: Achieved** — `/open-source/` now states the proprietary IP position clearly, site-wide footer/resource labels no longer advertise “Open Source,” and the sitemap/compliance-test surfaces were updated to match the corrected public language.

## Where We Left Off (Session 43 — 2026-04-06)

- Shipped: 1 rights-posture correction pass — proprietary IP notice rewrite for `/open-source/`, shared footer/resource label propagation to 72 HTML pages, sitemap/homepage copy updates, compliance test title update
- Tests: N/A — no automated test run in this session; the compliance test expectation was updated locally
- Deploy: pushed to `main` (`26b7afa`) · GitHub Pages auto

---

## Session Intent: Session 42
Fix the remaining dark-section contrast failures in light mode and catch all repeated instances of white/gray text logic applied to the wrong surfaces.
**Outcome: Achieved** — intentionally dark panels now keep white readable copy in light mode across the homepage, public ranks page, project/game hero/card bands, and the Vault Member rank sidebar; the homepage Vault-Forge paragraph was also returned to dark text on its light surface.

## Where We Left Off (Session 42 — 2026-04-06)

- Shipped: 1 contrast hardening pass — shared dark-panel text fix in `assets/style.css`, homepage/ranks inline cleanup in `index.html` and `ranks/index.html`, portal rank sidebar fix in `vault-member/portal.css`
- Tests: N/A — no additional automated verification run in this follow-up session
- Deploy: pushed to `main` (`f9109fe`) · GitHub Pages auto

---

## Session Intent: Session 41
Finish the light-mode contrast audit and remove the remaining unreadable gray and dark-on-dark text states.
**Outcome: Achieved** — the follow-up pass fixed the lingering contrast failures in shared game/project/detail patterns by darkening the secondary text scale, restoring bright titles on dark artwork, and replacing leftover dark surfaces with actual light-mode panels.

## Where We Left Off (Session 41 — 2026-04-06)

- Shipped: 1 contrast cleanup pass — darker blue-slate support text, readable hero/card titles on dark art, light-mode surfaces for shared game/project/detail panels
- Tests: N/A — no additional automated verification run in this follow-up session
- Deploy: pushed to `main` (`9862948`) · GitHub Pages auto

---

## Session Intent: Session 40
Fix the broken light-mode readability and make the light theme feel intentional and refined.
**Outcome: Achieved** — shared light-mode tokens and surfaces were overhauled in one pass; contrast is materially stronger and the mode now reads as a designed premium variant instead of a washed dark-theme inversion.

## Where We Left Off (Session 40 — 2026-04-06)

- Shipped: 2 theme-system improvements — refined global light palette/surfaces, browser theme-color synced to new light background
- Tests: 0 passing / 6 failing — Playwright `tests/theme-persistence.spec.js`; Chromium fails on existing `body[data-theme]` expectation, Firefox/WebKit executables missing locally
- Deploy: pushed to `main` (`7976f9b`) · GitHub Pages auto
